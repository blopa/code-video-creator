# Create a video of a javascript file

Create a video file showing line by line of a javascript file or React component.

I have no idea why I made this... but there you go.

## How to use
Run
```shell
npm install
```

To install dependencies, then run

```shell
npm run generate Test.jsx
```

Where "Test2.jsx" should be the path to your file.

PS: You need to have `ffmpeg` installed for this to work!
